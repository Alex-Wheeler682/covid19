Comparing Supervised Machine Learning Models and Time Series Models in Predicting COVID Cases Globally.

This is my second capstone project conducted while enrolled in Thinkful's Data Science Immersion program. Data was obtained from the John's Hopkin's public COVID-19 Repo, found here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

## Project Premise:
Can supervised machine learning models accurately predict global COVID-19 cases? How do these forecasts differ from time series models such as ARIMA? Moreover, what can we learn about supervised machine learning models' predictive power by applying them to a time series analysis?

### Models Examined:
This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all applicable models, but rather the various ones I have conducted the time series forecasts with, in order to compare results with an ARIMA model:
- Polynomial Regression
- Bayesian Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (RF)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ARIMA (**spoiler** Best Performing Model)

### Updates:
I fully intend to continue updating this project as I gather new data, refine algorithms and make improvements within the code.
